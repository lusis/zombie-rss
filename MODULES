How do I write modules?
-----------------------

They're mostly simple. All a module does is take data sent to it and parse it. 
There are a few requirements that a module must follow:

1) It must have a sub named MODULENAME_parse_data. For example, the fark.com
   module has the sub, fark_parse_data. The naming convention must follow the
   same as is the file name. So, the filename is fark.pl (case sensitive, duh)

2) It must return an array of hash references. Again, check the code in any
   of the current modules. The keys in each hash can be link, title, and descr.
   Each of these describes itself.

3) The MODULE_parse_data sub is passed 3 variables for your pleasure:
   a DBI reference, the hashref to the sql data for this news source, and
   finally the raw source content itself (html, xml, or other)

Scenario:
  The fark.pl module is loaded. fark_parse_data() is called. It uses the
  third argument, the raw content, and parses it. It pushes hashrefs into 
  an array and returns it after it has parsed all of the new articles.

This howto is mostly vague, but after reading it you should be able to discern what the modules are actually doing.

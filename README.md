# ZombieRSS
"Because RSS is dead...."

ZombieRss is a chance for me to work with some tools that:

1. I've not worked with in a while
2. I've never worked with at all

## Riak/Ripple
I've been jonesing for a reason to use Riak again. This was a good chance to do that.

## Twitter Bootstrap
I suck at UI. Twitter bootstrap does NOT suck at UI. My hope is that I can get better at UI by getting comfy with Bootstrap

# Setup
You'll need Riak running on localhost. I've only tested this with 1.0 so YMMV with anything else.

There's a little binscript to import a feed. Just pass it the URL to an RSS feed and it will pull it into the right buckets.

# TODO
A whole fuckton. I don't know where this will go but it's been fun already.

Some ideas:

- Multi-user support
- Better per-feed navigation
- Add feeds from the browser
- JSON API
- "Notes" - per user note functionality
- Private Feeds
- Social media hooks
- Some sort of peer registration system so you can see 'notes' from other installs

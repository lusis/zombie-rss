Yadda yadda, I got bored and came up with ideas...

And now on to disorganized ideas, they're sllightly grouped by lots of hyphens.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow "admins" to add URLs of RSS's for different sites, adding it under 
a given category perhaps? Adding categories if categories are used.. 
Suggest categorizing if there are too many news listings.

What else?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the <channel> tag to read all of the news sites available. Each RSS 
should have one near the top describing the page, etc... for example:

<channel>
   <title>Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters</title> 
   <link>http://slashdot.org/</link> 
   <description>News for nerds, stuff that matters</description> 
</channel>


Should an image be used? Random image sizes might make for bad form layout. 

<image>
   <title>Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters</title> 
   <url>http://images.slashdot.org/topics/topicslashdot.gif</url> 
   <link>http://slashdot.org/</link> 
</image>


Easy enough, right? :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


As far as crontab goes, should this thing attempt to archive stories? 
Sure it might become space-intensive, but would it be worth it to have a 
backlog? 

Crontab shenanigans -
   download all the new rss/rdf/xml news batches and update the sql backend with
   the new articles.

   Allow users to request updates? - Possible, allow only one update per hour
   ? Or actually update the news shit every hour? every 6 hours?

   use LWP for downloading?
   *** Save the files after use?


Allow flexible methods of user authentication, so that it's more ... 
flexible (kerberos, general php stuff authorization, whatnot...)
As such, require users, allow the admin(s) to link to a "signup" page. 
Have the config file for this newswhore determine the username based on 
the admin/whatever's preferences. Certain enables for htaccess 
authorization, OtherAuth(tm) so that it'll integrate to other sites flawlessly.

Settings for the users?

+ What sites to solicite? [User Settable]
   - Hook you up with mad checkboxes...

---[ Features I haven't implemented yet ]---------------------------------------
* Add threads/forks so that upcron.pl is efficient. Have one process/thread be busy constantly downloading news listings, and after each download is complete send a message to the reader/parser to parse the downloaded data. Reader should have a queue of listings to read. This could even be a 3-tier system: Download, Parse, Insertion. 
  Download --> Downloads unparsed data from sources, uses module to "grab" data
  Parse -----> Uses RSS or other means to make meaningful sense of the data
  Insertion -> Takes the data from Parse, and uploads it into the database.

* Admin section.
  - Manage Users, Prune Database, View Statistics, Add Feeds.

---[ Fixes, changes, etc. ] ----------------------------------------------------
* Rewrite mynews.pl to use divs instead of tables, should be less overhead. 
  - Is this worth it? It might break browsers like lynx and w3m, test first.
* Multiple-page configuration.
  - Personal Settings, News Sources, Filters, More?
* NNTP//RSS - it looks neat, get it running. (Requires jakarta Ant to build)
  - Generate RSS feeds for nonRSS news feeds?
* Rewrite how viewdata is handled, introduce 2 ways of storage.
  1) newslisting ID
  2) unixtime dating - this will make sql queries faster.
* Make it so that index.pl takes a 3rd method from the pages: sidebar
  - Just in case we want a sidebar (like... you know... the config page)

---[ Bugs!!! ]------------------------------------------------------------------
* cleanup.pl unmarks incorrect news, so it's probably removing the wrong news
  articles, too.

---[ Smaller, easier to implement things ]--------------------------------------

: User friendliness
- favorites. Let news be filed under user-specified categories
- custom listing: Allow subscription to user-specified keywords (Linux, Oracle, etc)
  ^ This could be easily filled by having a module that supports it.
- "Mail me a daily digest of news" - in config, easy to do...

: Portability 
- Ensure that rssnews is kosher between different DB implementations (mysql, postgres, etc?)

---[ Done and Done! ]-----------------------------------------------------------
- news searching, search for any given keyword under the listings of news
- Use rssnews.conf to define whether the auth is based on default, .htaccess, or other?  Currently, the only auth methods are htaccess and default.
- Modularity. WEEEEEEEE!
